# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Visual Product Matching Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop AI-powered product matching system that compares captured images with product catalog using visual similarity
# Details:
Create ProductMatcher class with findSimilarProducts() method that processes visual analysis results. Enhance product catalog with visual metadata including dominant colors, shapes, materials, and key visual features. Implement similarity scoring algorithm combining visual features, category matching, and brand recognition. Create product comparison matrix for ranking similar items. Add filtering capabilities by category, price range, and feature similarity. Implement result ranking based on visual similarity confidence and product relevance. Create structured response format with matched products, similarity scores, and matching rationale. Add fallback logic for low-confidence matches with broader category suggestions.

# Test Strategy:
Product matching accuracy tests with known similar items, similarity scoring validation tests, performance tests with large catalog, edge case testing with unclear images, A/B testing for ranking algorithms, user feedback integration for match quality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Similarity Scoring Algorithm Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop core similarity scoring components for multimodal inputs
### Details:
Implement cosine similarity for text embeddings (BERT), structural similarity index (SSIM) for images, and dynamic time warping (DTW) for audio. Performance: <300ms latency per modality. Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliance through alt-text fallbacks. Integration: Shared embedding space between text encoder (Transformer), image encoder (CNN), and audio encoder (Wav2Vec2) using intermediate fusion [3][4].

## 2. Fallback Threshold Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Define failure detection thresholds and modality fallback sequences
### Details:
Set confidence thresholds: image (SSIM <0.85), text (cosine similarity <0.75), audio (DTW distance >1.2). Fallback logic: Primary modality failure triggers cross-modal verification (e.g., failed image analysis uses text captions). Performance: Fallback activation <150ms. Accessibility: Voice command override when visual thresholds fail. Integration: Decision-level fusion with weighted outputs based on threshold breaches [2][4].

## 3. Ranking System Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Integrate scoring with catalog metadata enhancement
### Details:
Develop hybrid ranking algorithm: 60% similarity score, 30% metadata freshness, 10% user context. Performance: Handle 1000+ items/sec. Accessibility: Screen reader-compatible ranking explanations. Integration: Real-time alignment between voice queries (transcribed via Whisper), camera inputs (YOLO object detection), and text metadata using late fusion [1][3]. Catalog metadata enrichment via BERT embeddings.
