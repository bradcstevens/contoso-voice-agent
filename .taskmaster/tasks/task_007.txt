# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Integrated Conversation Flow System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create seamless conversation experience that combines text, voice, and visual inputs in a unified interface
# Details:
Create ConversationOrchestrator class that manages multi-modal input coordination and response generation. Implement conversation flow that can handle simultaneous or sequential voice and visual inputs. Create unified message format that supports text, voice transcripts, and visual analysis results. Implement context-aware response generation that references previous visual searches and voice interactions. Create conversation branching logic for different input combinations (voice+visual, text+visual, voice-only). Add conversation summarization for long multi-modal sessions. Implement proper error handling when one modality fails while others continue working. Create conversation export functionality for user reference.

# Test Strategy:
Multi-modal conversation flow tests, context preservation validation tests, error handling tests for partial system failures, conversation quality assessment tests, user experience testing for flow transitions, performance tests for complex conversations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Input Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive system to classify and categorize different types of user inputs including text, voice, gestures, and multi-modal combinations
### Details:
Design input type detection algorithms, create classification matrices for single and combined inputs, establish priority hierarchies for conflicting inputs, and define input validation rules

## 2. Design Conversation State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a robust state management system to track conversation context, user preferences, and interaction history across different input modalities
### Details:
Implement conversation state tracking, create context preservation mechanisms, design user session management, and establish state transition rules for different input combinations

## 3. Implement Multi-Modal Decision Trees [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create branching logic trees that handle different combinations of input types and determine appropriate response pathways
### Details:
Build decision tree algorithms for input combination handling, create response pathway mapping, implement priority resolution for conflicting inputs, and design fallback mechanisms for unrecognized combinations

## 4. Develop Real-Time Coordination Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Build a real-time processing engine that coordinates multiple input streams simultaneously and manages temporal synchronization
### Details:
Implement real-time input stream processing, create temporal alignment algorithms, design latency compensation mechanisms, and establish synchronization protocols for multi-modal inputs

## 5. Create Error Handling and Recovery System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for input processing failures, ambiguous inputs, and system recovery mechanisms
### Details:
Design error detection algorithms, create graceful degradation strategies, implement recovery protocols for failed input processing, and establish user feedback mechanisms for error resolution
