# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Voice-Triggered Camera Capture System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement automatic camera capture functionality triggered by voice commands and questions
# Details:
Create VoiceCameraCoordinator service that listens for specific voice patterns and triggers camera capture. Implement natural language processing to detect visual search intent from voice input (phrases like 'find boots like these', 'show me similar', 'what is this'). Create automatic image capture with visual feedback (flash effect, capture sound). Implement frame selection algorithm to capture the best quality image from video stream. Add manual capture button as fallback option. Create CaptureEvent system for coordinating between voice detection and camera capture. Implement proper timing to ensure user has positioned item before capture. Add visual indicators showing when system is ready for capture and when capture occurs.

# Test Strategy:
Voice pattern recognition accuracy tests, capture timing tests, image quality validation tests, user experience testing for capture feedback, integration tests between voice and camera systems, edge case testing for simultaneous voice/visual input

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define NLP Pattern Recognition for Visual Search Commands [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish natural language processing patterns to identify and classify visual search intents from voice commands, including object detection, scene analysis, and navigation requests.
### Details:
Create regex patterns, intent classification models, and entity extraction rules for commands like 'find the red car', 'show me the kitchen', 'locate the nearest exit'. Include confidence scoring and ambiguity resolution mechanisms.

## 2. Develop Frame Selection Criteria Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Design algorithms to determine optimal camera frame selection based on parsed visual search intents, considering factors like object visibility, lighting conditions, and camera positioning.
### Details:
Implement scoring mechanisms for frame quality, object prominence, spatial relationships, and temporal stability. Include fallback strategies for when primary targets are not visible or partially occluded.

## 3. Implement Voice-Camera Synchronization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create timing coordination mechanisms between voice command detection and camera frame capture to ensure real-time responsiveness while maintaining system stability.
### Details:
Design buffer management, latency compensation, and priority queuing systems. Include timeout handling, concurrent request management, and resource allocation strategies for multiple simultaneous search requests.

## 4. Establish Performance Optimization and Constraint Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Optimize the integrated system for real-time performance while managing computational constraints, memory usage, and response time requirements.
### Details:
Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed patterns, parallel processing for NLP and vision tasks, and adaptive quality settings based on system load. Include monitoring and alerting for performance degradation.
