# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Visual Analysis System with GPT-4.1-mini
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create visual analysis service using Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini for multi-modal image processing via AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
# Details:
Implement VisualAnalysisService class with analyzeImage() method that accepts base64 encoded images. Configure GPT-4.1-mini model with specialized prompts for outdoor gear identification and feature extraction. Create image preprocessing pipeline for optimal analysis (resize, format conversion, quality optimization). Implement product matching algorithm that compares visual features with catalog metadata. Add confidence scoring for visual matches. Create structured response format for visual analysis results including detected objects, colors, materials, and brand identification. Handle large image files with compression and chunking. Implement caching for repeated visual queries to reduce API costs.

# Test Strategy:
Visual analysis accuracy tests with diverse product images, performance tests for image processing pipeline, API response validation tests, confidence score calibration tests, cache effectiveness tests, error handling for malformed images

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Image Preprocessing Pipeline Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and specify the complete image preprocessing pipeline including input validation, format standardization, quality assessment, and transformation stages
### Details:
Create detailed specifications for image preprocessing stages including: input format validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP), resolution normalization, color space conversion, noise reduction filters, brightness/contrast adjustment, and image quality scoring. Define error handling for corrupted or unsupported images.

## 2. Implement Feature Extraction and Enhancement Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop image enhancement and feature extraction components for optimal product matching preparation
### Details:
Implement advanced preprocessing modules including: edge detection algorithms, histogram equalization, sharpening filters, background removal techniques, and feature point extraction. Configure parameters for different product categories (clothing, electronics, etc.) and establish quality thresholds.

## 3. Configure Product Matching Algorithm Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Define and optimize parameters for the product matching algorithm including similarity thresholds, weighting factors, and matching criteria
### Details:
Establish matching algorithm parameters including: feature vector similarity thresholds (0.7-0.95 range), color histogram weights, texture analysis parameters, shape descriptor coefficients, and confidence scoring mechanisms. Define category-specific parameter sets and fallback matching strategies.

## 4. Design Caching Strategy and Response Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement caching mechanisms and response formatting strategies to optimize cost and performance
### Details:
Design multi-tier caching system including: processed image cache with TTL policies, feature vector storage, matching result caching, and API response optimization. Implement structured response formatting with confidence scores, match rankings, and metadata. Configure cache invalidation strategies and cost monitoring.
