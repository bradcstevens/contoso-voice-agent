# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Voice Processing with Azure OpenAI Realtime API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime API (gpt-4o-realtime-preview) for real-time voice conversations using AZURE_VOICE_ENDPOINT
# Details:
Create WebSocket connection to Azure OpenAI Realtime API using the gpt-4o-realtime-preview model. Implement custom Web Audio worklets for real-time audio capture and playback with <100ms latency. Create VoiceService class with methods for startRecording(), stopRecording(), and processAudioStream(). Handle audio format conversion (PCM 16-bit, 24kHz sample rate). Implement voice activity detection (VAD) for automatic speech detection. Add proper error handling for network issues and API rate limits. Create voice-specific UI components with visual indicators for recording/processing states. Implement session management for voice conversations with proper authentication using Azure API keys.

# Test Strategy:
Mock Azure Realtime API responses, audio processing unit tests, latency measurement tests, voice activity detection accuracy tests, WebSocket connection reliability tests, cross-browser audio API compatibility testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. WebSocket Connection Setup and Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure WebSocket connection establishment with JWT token-based authentication and connection state management
### Details:
Create WebSocket client with automatic reconnection logic, implement JWT token validation on connection, handle authentication failures, and establish heartbeat mechanism for connection monitoring. Include error handling for network timeouts and connection drops.

## 2. Audio Format Conversion Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop audio format conversion system to handle multiple input formats and convert to optimal streaming format
### Details:
Implement audio format detection, create conversion pipeline supporting PCM, MP3, WAV formats, optimize for real-time streaming with minimal latency, and handle sample rate conversion. Include audio quality validation and error handling for unsupported formats.

## 3. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Build real-time voice activity detection system to identify speech segments and reduce unnecessary data transmission
### Details:
Implement energy-based VAD algorithm with adaptive thresholds, create silence detection with configurable sensitivity, optimize for real-time processing with <50ms detection latency, and include noise gate functionality to filter background noise.

## 4. Web Audio Worklet Development [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create custom Web Audio worklets for low-latency audio processing and real-time stream handling
### Details:
Develop AudioWorkletProcessor for real-time audio capture and processing, implement circular buffer management for smooth audio streaming, create custom audio nodes for VAD integration, and optimize for <100ms total latency including processing time.
