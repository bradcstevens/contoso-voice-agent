# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize Performance for Real-Time Multi-Modal Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations for concurrent voice, visual, and text processing with minimal latency
# Details:
Implement request queuing and prioritization for Azure OpenAI API calls across dual endpoints. Create intelligent caching system for visual analysis results and voice processing. Implement image compression and optimization pipeline for faster visual analysis. Create WebSocket connection pooling and management for concurrent voice streams. Implement lazy loading for UI components and progressive image loading. Create performance monitoring with metrics for response times, API usage, and user interaction latency. Implement resource cleanup and memory management for long-running sessions. Add performance budgets and monitoring alerts. Create CDN integration for static assets and optimize bundle sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Performance benchmarking tests for each modality, load testing for concurrent users, memory leak detection tests, API response time monitoring tests, image processing performance tests, WebSocket connection stress tests, bundle size analysis

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Performance Requirements and Accessibility Standards [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish quantitative targets and compliance frameworks for multimodal caching
### Details:
Set latency targets (<200ms voice, <500ms camera), cache hit ratio (>85%), and WCAG 2.2 compliance for cached content. Define throughput requirements per modality (e.g., 1000 TPS for text). Document integration points: voice-to-text transcription caching, image metadata reuse across modalities.

## 2. Design Modal-Specific Caching Layers [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create dedicated caching strategies per input modality
### Details:
Implement three parallel caching pipelines: 1) Voice: Cache ASR outputs and speech embeddings using LRU eviction 2) Camera: Precompute and store image embeddings with FAISS indexing 3) Text: Cache retrieval results and LLM intermediate states. Apply modal-specific TTL policies (e.g., 5min for voice, 1hr for images).

## 3. Build Cross-Modal Cache Coordination [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop shared caching mechanisms for multimodal reuse
### Details:
Implement context-aware caching using Model Context Protocol (MCP): 1) Create unified embedding space for cross-modal similarity matching 2) Deploy D3QN-based eviction controller prioritizing frequently reused multimodal objects 3) Establish cache invalidation webhooks for upstream data changes. Ensure <15% redundant storage across modalities.

## 4. Implement Priority-Aware Request Queuing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Design concurrency-optimized request scheduling
### Details:
Build tiered queueing system: 1) Real-time queue (voice/camera) with strict SLA enforcement 2) Batch processing queue (text analysis) 3) Dynamic prioritization engine using latency targets and user context. Include circuit breakers for overload protection and accessibility-compliant fallback paths.

## 5. Integrate Monitoring and Adaptive Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Deploy observability and self-tuning mechanisms
### Details:
Embed telemetry: 1) Cache hit/miss ratios per modality 2) End-to-end latency percentiles 3) Concurrency load metrics. Implement closed-loop controller using reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust: cache sizes, queue thresholds, and cross-modal prefetching based on real-time demand patterns.
