# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Fallback Systems
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust error handling for camera access, voice processing, and visual analysis with graceful degradation
# Details:
Create ErrorBoundary components for each modality (camera, voice, visual analysis) with specific error recovery strategies. Implement permission handling for camera and microphone access with user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms. Create fallback modes: text-only when camera/mic unavailable, voice-only when camera fails, camera-only when voice fails. Implement API error handling for Azure OpenAI endpoints with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns. Create user notification system for temporary failures vs permanent issues. Implement offline detection and queue system for when network is unavailable. Add comprehensive logging for debugging multi-modal issues. Create health check endpoints for monitoring system status.

# Test Strategy:
Error scenario simulation tests, permission denial handling tests, API failure recovery tests, offline functionality tests, error boundary isolation tests, user experience testing for error states, monitoring and alerting validation tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Voice/Audio Error Recovery Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish comprehensive error recovery mechanisms for voice and audio processing failures, including speech recognition errors, audio quality issues, and microphone/speaker hardware failures
### Details:
Design recovery strategies for voice modality including: automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction, audio quality degradation handling, noise cancellation fallbacks, microphone failure detection and alternative input methods, speaker output failure recovery, and voice command retry mechanisms with progressive timeout strategies

## 2. Define Visual/Display Error Recovery Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop error recovery protocols for visual interface failures, display rendering issues, and camera/visual input problems
### Details:
Create recovery mechanisms for visual modality including: display rendering failure recovery, UI component error handling, camera input failure detection and alternatives, visual recognition error correction, screen resolution adaptation, color blindness accommodations, and progressive visual degradation strategies for low-bandwidth scenarios

## 3. Define Touch/Haptic Error Recovery Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish error handling for touch interface failures, haptic feedback issues, and gesture recognition problems
### Details:
Implement recovery strategies for touch/haptic modality including: touchscreen calibration error recovery, gesture recognition failure handling, haptic feedback device malfunction detection, multi-touch input error correction, pressure sensitivity adjustment, and alternative input method activation when touch interfaces fail

## 4. Design Fallback Mode Triggers and Degradation Paths [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create intelligent fallback mode activation system with cascading degradation paths across all modalities based on failure severity and user context
### Details:
Develop comprehensive fallback trigger system including: failure severity assessment algorithms, cross-modality compensation strategies, graceful degradation decision trees, user preference-based fallback prioritization, emergency mode activation for critical failures, performance monitoring thresholds for proactive fallback activation, and recovery path optimization based on available modalities and user capabilities
