# Task ID: 6
# Title: Enhance Session Management for Multi-Modal Context
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend existing session management to handle voice, visual, and text conversation context with comprehensive history tracking
# Details:
Extend ConversationSession model to include visual_history, voice_interactions, and multi_modal_context fields. Create SessionManager class with methods for addVisualSearch(), addVoiceInteraction(), and getMultiModalContext(). Implement context preservation across different interaction modalities with proper serialization. Create conversation threading that maintains context when switching between text, voice, and visual inputs. Add visual search history with image thumbnails and analysis results. Implement context injection for AI prompts that includes recent visual searches and voice interactions. Create session cleanup and optimization to prevent memory bloat. Add session analytics for tracking multi-modal usage patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Session persistence tests across modalities, context injection validation tests, memory usage tests for long sessions, concurrent session handling tests, session cleanup verification tests, context accuracy tests for AI responses

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design multi-modal data structure schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core data structure and schema that can accommodate different modalities (text, image, audio, video) while preserving context relationships and metadata
### Details:
Create a flexible schema that includes modality type identifiers, content payload structures, timestamp information, and cross-modal reference mechanisms. Define field types, validation rules, and extensibility patterns for future modalities.

## 2. Implement context preservation mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop serialization methods that maintain contextual relationships between different modal elements and preserve temporal/spatial associations
### Details:
Design algorithms for encoding context links, reference chains, and dependency graphs between modal elements. Implement compression strategies for efficient storage while maintaining context integrity and enabling fast retrieval.

## 3. Create serialization and deserialization protocols [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement the actual serialization format with encoding/decoding functions, validation, and error handling for multi-modal context fields
### Details:
Develop binary and text-based serialization formats, implement streaming capabilities for large multi-modal datasets, create validation functions for data integrity, and build error recovery mechanisms for corrupted or incomplete serialized data.
