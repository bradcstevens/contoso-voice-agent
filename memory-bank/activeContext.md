# Active Context - Contoso Voice Agent

## Current Focus
Memory Bank initialization completed. System ready for development workflow with structured context management.

## Active Components
- Memory Bank system initialized with complete directory structure
- Core context files created (project brief, product context, technical context, system patterns)
- Ready for task-based development workflow

## Immediate Context
**Project State**: Established codebase with working frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) components
**AI Integration**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4o and Realtime Voice API configured
**Architecture**: Real-time WebSocket communication with voice and text capabilities

## Development Environment Status
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript, Zustand state management
- Backend: FastAPI with WebSocket support and AI integration
- Audio: Web Audio API integration for voice processing
- Deployment: Docker containerization ready

## Available Capabilities
1. **Text Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging with AI assistant
2. **Voice Interface**: Interactive voice calling with real-time audio
3. **Product Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestion engine
4. **Session Management**: Persistent conversation context
5. **WebSocket Communication**: Bidirectional real-time data flow

## Next Steps Ready
Memory Bank is fully initialized and ready to support:
- Feature development and enhancements
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- Architecture improvements
- New component integration
- Performance optimizations

## Context Preservation
All project knowledge is now captured in Memory Bank structure:
- `/memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Core project identity
- `/memory-bank/productContext.md` - Product vision and business context
- `/memory-bank/techContext.md` - Technical architecture and stack
- `/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Code patterns and organization
