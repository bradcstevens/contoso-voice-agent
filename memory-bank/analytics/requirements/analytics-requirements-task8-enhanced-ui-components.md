# REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS: Task 8 Enhanced UI Components for Multi-Modal Interface

## üîç DISCOVER PHASE

### Problem Statement
- **User Problem**: Users need seamless multi-modal interactions combining camera, voice, and text inputs within a unified interface that maintains context across modality switches while providing immediate visual feedback and accessibility support.
- **Business Problem**: The current organism-level components (AdvancedCameraWidget, MultiModalOrchestrator) lack template and page-level orchestration, preventing complete user experiences and limiting the system's ability to deliver cohesive multi-modal workflows.
- **Technical Problem**: Missing template layer between organism components and complete pages creates implementation gaps for layout coordination, state management, and cross-modal event handling at the user experience level.
- **Current State**: Foundation complete with operational organism components providing camera integration, multi-modal orchestration, and accessibility compliance, but no template or page-level implementations.
- **Desired State**: Complete template and page ecosystem enabling full multi-modal user experiences with camera-enabled chat, visual search results display, and comprehensive error recovery workflows.
